# SP1 Simple Project Template

This is an end-to-end [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1) project that can generate a proof for a simple addition program.

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/getting-started/install)

## Running the Project

There are 3 main ways to run this project: execute a program, generate a core proof, and
generate an EVM-compatible proof.

### Build the Program

The program is automatically built through `script/build.rs` when the script is built.

### Execute the Program

To run the program without generating a proof:

```sh
cd script
cargo run --release -- --execute
```

This will execute the program and display the output.

### Generate an SP1 Core Proof

To generate an SP1 [core proof](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/generating-proofs/proof-types#core-default) for your program:

```sh
cd script
cargo run --release -- --prove
```

## Using the Prover Network

We highly recommend using the [Succinct Prover Network](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/network/introduction) for any non-trivial programs or benchmarking purposes. For more information, see the [key setup guide](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/network/developers/key-setup) to get started.

To get started, copy the example environment file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, set the `SP1_PROVER` environment variable to `network` and set the `NETWORK_PRIVATE_KEY`
environment variable to your whitelisted private key.

For example, to generate an EVM-compatible proof using the prover network, run the following
command:

```sh
SP1_PROVER=network NETWORK_PRIVATE_KEY=... cargo run --release --bin evm
```
